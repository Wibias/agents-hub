  Use when auditing prose for AI writing tells, humanizing LLM-sounding text,
  reviewing docs/blog/README/PR/email/essay copy for ChatGPT cadence, "writing
  ticks", signs of AI writing, AI slop in text, or when the user asks to make
  writing sound human. Not for product UX microcopy systems or visual UI taste.

# Writing ticks

Audit and rewrite prose against known LLM style patterns (source:
[Wikipedia:Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing)).

**Core principle:** Signs are *symptoms*, not a verdict. Fix the hollow voice —
generic significance, puffy analysis, template structure — not just the
surface words. Synonym-swapping "delve" while keeping empty legacy claims is a
failed audit.

## When to use

- "Does this sound AI?" / "humanize this" / "remove AI writing ticks"
- Docs, README, blog, email, essay, PR description, release notes, proposal
- Reviewing agent-drafted prose before ship

## When not to use

- **UI / marketing landing copy** or **product microcopy** → dedicated design/copy skills when present (not in this hub yet)
- **Code style** → domain skills, not this
- Claiming "human-written" as a legal/forensic fact — this is a style audit only

## Workflow

### 1. Intake

- Get the full text (paste, path, or selection). Prefer the real draft, not a summary.
- Note audience and register (technical, casual, encyclopedic, sales). Do not
  force Wikipedia tone onto marketing or chatty email.
- Mode: **audit only** (default) or **audit + rewrite**.

### 2. Load the checklist

Read `references/signs-checklist.md` before scoring. For edge cases or Wikipedia
wiki-markup tells, fetch the live page:
`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing`

Do **not** rely on GPTZero-class detectors as primary evidence.

### 3. Audit (pass every category)

Score findings as:

| Severity | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **High** | Dense AI vocab cluster, legacy/puff template, negative parallelisms stacked, outline "Despite challenges… future outlook" formula |
| **Med** | Occasional copula avoidance, rule-of-three lists, superficial -ing closers, em-dash cadence |
| **Low** | Single common word, one bold phrase, minor elegant variation |

For each finding: **quote** → **sign id** (from checklist) → **why it reads LLM** → **fix direction**.

### 4. Report shape (required)

```markdown
## Verdict
[clean | mild ticks | heavy LLM voice] — one sentence why

## Findings
1. **[High|Med|Low]** `sign-id` — "quoted span…"
   - Why: …
   - Fix: …

## Density notes
- AI-vocab hits (count + words)
- Structural templates present/absent
- Copula avoidance / negative parallelisms / RO3

## Keep as-is
- Legitimate technical terms, brand voice, intentional rhetoric
```

Never invent findings to look thorough. Empty findings + clean verdict is fine.

### 5. Rewrite (only if asked or mode = rewrite)

Rewrite goals, in order:

1. **Specific over grand** — drop unearned "pivotal / testament / landscape" claims
2. **Plain copulas** — prefer *is/are/has* over *serves as / boasts / stands as*
3. **Kill template arcs** — no forced Challenges → Future Outlook unless content needs it
4. **Break false triples** — two items or a real list beats decorative threes
5. **One idea per sentence** — cut trailing "-ing" significance clauses
6. **Match the user's voice** — if samples exist, mirror them; else plain and concrete

After rewrite: re-run steps 3–4 on the new text. Ship only when High findings are gone
and Med findings are intentional or rare.

### 6. Anti-patterns (do not)

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "I replaced delve with explore" | Vocab alone ≠ human; structure and puff remain |
| "Add more personality with emojis" | Emoji chrome is itself an AI/style tell in serious prose |
| "Make it more formal to sound human" | Formality without specificity still reads LLM |
| "Detector said 12% AI so we're fine" | Detectors error; checklist judgment wins |
| "This is technical so ticks don't matter" | Technical prose still benefits from plain verbs |

## Sibling skills

- Product voice / UX microcopy → project design or copy skills when present

## Source hygiene

Checklist is a **condensed field guide** adapted for general writing. Upstream:
WikiProject AI Cleanup essay (descriptive, not Wikipedia policy). Patterns drift
as models change — prefer live page when the draft is contested or post-dates
the skill.
