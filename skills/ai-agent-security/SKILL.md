description: >-
  Defends and tests LLM applications, AI agents, and MCP-based tool systems
  against AI-specific threats: prompt injection (direct and indirect), tool
  poisoning, MCP server compromise, model and data poisoning, vector/embedding
  weaknesses, guardrail evasion, and LLM red-teaming. Use when building or
  auditing agent pipelines, RAG systems, MCP integrations, or any LLM feature
  with tool invocation, retrieval, or user-facing output. Distinct from
  security-review (audit of classic app/API code), audit-tooling (SARIF/Semgrep
  toolchain selection), fuzzing-and-testing (native-code harness fuzzing), and
  smart-contract-security (blockchain/Solidity). Does not cover C2 infrastructure
  or offensive adversarial exploitation of production systems you do not own.

## Overview

AI agents and LLM applications introduce a distinct class of security risks that classical app-security controls do not cover. The threat surface includes:

- **MCP tool poisoning** -- hidden instructions in tool descriptions hijack agent behavior (OWASP MCP03, MITRE ATLAS AML.T0010)
- **Prompt injection (direct and indirect)** -- injected instructions in user input or retrieved artifacts override intended behavior (AML.T0051, OWASP LLM01)
- **RAG pipeline injection** -- poisoned documents in the retrieval corpus plant instructions that execute when retrieved (AML.T0051.001)
- **Agentic tool misuse** -- excessive agency or insufficient least-privilege lets a compromised agent perform unauthorized actions (AML.T0053)
- **Model and data poisoning** -- manipulated training/fine-tuning data or backdoored weights cause attacker-controlled misbehavior (AML.T0020, AML.T0018)
- **Vector/embedding weaknesses** -- embedding inversion, cross-tenant leakage, and retrieval poisoning in RAG vector stores (OWASP LLM08, AML.T0024)
- **LLM guardrail evasion** -- jailbreaks and multi-turn escalation bypass safety layers (AML.T0054)
- **LLM red-teaming at scale** -- continuous automated probing to detect regressions in safety/security posture (AML.T0051, CI/CD gate)

## Decision Tree: Which Reference to Use

```
What is the threat you are facing?

MCP server in agent stack (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code)

Agentic AI tool invocation governance
  -> references/prompt-injection.md (agentic controls section)
  Least-privilege allowlisting, HITL, NeMo Guardrails, audit logging
  Uses: NeMo Guardrails, jsonschema, AWS STS

Guardrail deployment (Llama Guard, NeMo, LLM Guard pipeline)
  -> references/llm-red-teaming.md (guardrails section)
  Runtime classification and scanning of inputs and outputs
  Uses: Llama Guard 3, NeMo Guardrails, LLM Guard

LLM red-teaming (garak, promptfoo, PyRIT)
  -> references/llm-red-teaming.md
  Probe suites, CI/CD regression gates, multi-turn attacks
  Uses: garak, Promptfoo, PyRIT, DeepTeam

RAG pipeline injection testing
  -> references/llm-red-teaming.md (RAG section)
  Poisoned corpus documents, embedding manipulation, retrieval probing

Data poisoning / model backdoors / ML supply chain
  -> references/data-poisoning.md
  Training data integrity, activation clustering, spectral signatures
  Uses: ART (ActivationDefence, SpectralSignatureDefense), Cleanlab, safetensors

Vector store weaknesses (embedding inversion, cross-tenant leakage)
  -> references/data-poisoning.md (vector section)
  Membership inference, namespace isolation, retrieval poisoning
  Uses: sentence-transformers, qdrant-client, vec2text
```

## Core Security Controls (All AI/LLM Features)

These controls apply regardless of which threat class is primary:

1. **Treat all model output as untrusted input.** Never pass LLM output to `eval`, SQL, shell, `innerHTML`, or file paths without parsing, schema validation, and encoding.

```typescript
// BAD
await db.query(await llm.generate(`Write SQL for: ${userQuestion}`));

// GOOD
const intent = CommandSchema.parse(JSON.parse(await llm.replyJson(userMessage)));
await runAllowlistedAction(intent.action, intent.params);
```

2. **The system prompt is not a security boundary.** Enforce permissions in code, not prompt text.

3. **Keep secrets and per-user data out of prompts.** Anything in the context window can be echoed back (OWASP LLM07).

4. **Scope tool permissions to the minimum.** Require human confirmation for any destructive or irreversible action.

5. **Bound consumption.** Cap tokens, request rate, and recursion/loop depth to prevent runaway agent costs (OWASP LLM10).

6. **Validate retrieval.** In RAG, treat the vector store as a trust boundary. Scan retrieved chunks for injection markers before concatenating into the prompt.
